## Overview

VOIDCLI is an AI terminal assistant that uses a strict ReAct workflow to reason, plan, execute tools, and generate outputs.

The agent can:

- Generate complete websites from prompts
- Clone public homepages
- Download and localize website assets
- Edit generated websites
- Launch instant previews
- Execute multi-step workflows through tool use

VOIDCLI follows a structured execution loop:

```text
START
THINK
TOOL
OBSERVE
OUTPUT
```

This architecture enables reliable planning, tool usage, and iterative website generation.

## Features

### 🌐 Homepage Cloning

Clone any public homepage by simply providing a URL.

VOIDCLI automatically:

- Fetches homepage HTML
- Extracts CSS assets
- Extracts JavaScript assets
- Extracts image assets
- Downloads assets locally
- Rewrites asset URLs
- Creates a self-contained clone

Example:

```text
https://example.com
```

Generated output:

```text
generated/
└── example clone/
    ├── index.html
    └── assets/
```

Homepage cloning is intentionally limited to a single page and does not perform recursive crawling.

---

### 🎨 Website Generation

Generate complete websites using natural language.

Example:

```text
Create a modern startup landing page for NIRBHAYA
```

Supported website types:

- Startup websites
- SaaS landing pages
- Product pages
- Portfolio websites
- Marketing websites
- Event websites
- Business websites

Design capabilities:

- Modern responsive layouts
- Glassmorphism
- Gradients
- Animations
- Hero sections
- Feature sections
- Pricing sections
- Testimonials
- CTA sections

---

### ✏️ Website Editing

Modify existing generated websites.

Examples:

```text
Change the hero background to a gradient
```

```text
Replace the heading with "Welcome to NIRBHAYA"
```

```text
Add a pricing section
```

VOIDCLI attempts targeted edits before regenerating entire pages.

---

### 🚀 Automatic Preview Server

After generation or cloning, VOIDCLI automatically launches a local preview server.

Features:

- Automatic port selection
- Existing preview cleanup
- Browser auto-open
- Preview URL reporting

Example:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:3000
```

## Troubleshooting

### TypeScript Check

```bash
npm run check
```

Expected:

```text
tsc --noEmit
```

with no errors.

---

### Preview Not Loading

Run manually:

```bash
npx http-server generated/website\ clone
```

Open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8080
```

---
